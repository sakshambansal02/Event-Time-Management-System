# Event-Time-Management-System


Overview
<br>
In this project, I have implemented a basic Event Time Management System using C. My aim was to create a system that can handle and manipulate event times efficiently, leveraging custom structures for representing time and events.

<br>

Files
<br>
event.h: This is the header file where I've defined the structures and functions essential for managing events and times.
<br>
event.c: Here, I've implemented all the functions declared in event.h.
<br>
main.c: This main file includes examples and basic tests to demonstrate the functionality of the system.
<br>

Usage
<br>
In the main.c file, I have provided example usage of the system. It's a good place to see how to create events, access their properties, and calculate the time elapsed between them.
